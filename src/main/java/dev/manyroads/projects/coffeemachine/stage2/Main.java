/**
 * Now let's consider a scenario where you need a lot of coffeeâ€”perhaps you're hosting a party with many guests! In such cases,
 * it's better to make preparations in advance.
 * <p>
 * In this stage, you will ask the user to enter the desired number of coffee cups. Based on this input, you will calculate
 * the necessary amounts of water, coffee, and milk needed to prepare the specified quantity of coffee.
 * <p>
 * Please note that the coffee machine won't actually make any coffee in this stage; instead, it will simply compute the
 * required ingredients.
 * <p>
 * Objectives
 * Let's break down the task into several steps:
 * <p>
 * Read the number of coffee cups from the input.
 * Calculate the amount of each ingredient needed. One cup of coffee requires:
 * 200 ml of water
 * 50 ml of milk
 * 15 g of coffee beans
 * Output the required ingredient amounts back to the user.
 * Example 1: a dialogue with a user might look like this
 * <p>
 * Write how many cups of coffee you will need:
 * > 25
 * For 25 cups of coffee you will need:
 * 5000 ml of water
 * 1250 ml of milk
 * 375 g of coffee beans
